tdlite
================================================================

To install, simply extract into your localhost.

Tdlite features intelligent database creation, so just type the name of the database you want after tdlite/ and it'll be created.

eg. *localhost/tdlite/mylist*

Deleting the .sqlite files in the db folder resets that database.
